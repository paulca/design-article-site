<h1>Mobile App Design: Getting to the point Part 2:  Building a small eCommerce site.</h1>


	<p>Following on from my earlier article, I want to put into practice the principles that I isolated by looking at GMail, Twitter and Facebook. I&#8217;ll apply the principles to one of the most common of web applications: the online store.</p>


	<p>I want to look at three typical online store pages and then go through some ideas about how best to apply mobile-design principles to the pages.</p>


	<p>Search page
Search is probably the most often-used feature of an online store. The search results page, then should be useful and efficient at moving the customer along to where they want to go.</p>


	<p>Browse page
The browse page is probably one of the first pages that a visitor to an online store will hit. It&#8217;s probably one of the links off the home page, and it will contain a sub-section of editorial content relevent to a theme or category.</p>


	<p>View item page
Viewing an item is the point at which the customer reviews and item and adds it to their cart.</p>


	<h2>Paper sketches</h2>


	<p>I start with some simple paper-wireframes to sketch out an idea of where things will be:</p>


	<p><img src="browse.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>The browse page looks complex, but I&#8217;ve brought in several of the principles from what was learned. The first step is to establish a simple branding element at the top of the page. Next, while browsing, it&#8217;s important to provide the customer with information about what they&#8217;re looking at, so that comes next. In an eCommerce application, search is typically one of the first things that customers look for, so that comes next. (unlike in GMail where search comes after the message listing). Following this are the listings for the page, including a few links to other possible pages, such as &#8216;popular picks&#8217; and &#8216;special offers.&#8217;</p>


	<p>Navigation is removed right down to the bottom&#8230; if a customer needs any of these links, they&#8217;ll find them there, but they&#8217;re not immediately important for browsing within a category.</p>


	<p><img src="search.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Things start to get nice and simple on the search results page. Results should be displayed as concisely as possible.</p>


	<p><img src="view.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<h2>Wireframes</h2>


	<p>The view page has a simple, compact layout. The title is displayed prominently at the top of the page, along with a picture of the book. The three next most important things follow: price, author and the crucial &#8216;add to basket&#8217; option. A &#8216;full details&#8217; link rounds it out. The search box is provided again, but this time above the main navigation, as it&#8217;s lower in the priority list on this page.</p>


	<p>The next step is to wireframe these pages, building on and refining what we&#8217;ve prepared in the sketches.</p>


	<p>The browse page was pretty much nailed in the wireframe. The priority of the elements is spot on and the main wireframe just tightens things up.</p>


	<p>There&#8217;s no real reason to hide the full details of an item on the view item page. Perhaps, if the description was really long, it would be a bit unweildly, but including a short description would round the page out some more.</p>


	<p>Reflecting on the search page, the single most important thing is the results, so they should be given the highest priority. Any subsidiary elements, such as the search field itself, do just fine below the results.</p>
	
	
<p>The wireframes that will be shipped to our designer:</p>

	<h3>Basic <span class="caps">HTML</span></h3>


	<p>The beauty of mobile sites is that we don&#8217;t need to learn a new technology to implement them. Because the name of the game is simplicity, the markup to produce great looking sites can and should be very simple. In addition, most of the devices on the market today fully support <span class="caps">CSS</span>, so making sites that are not only mobile-friendly, but aesthetically pleasing is simpler than ever.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://www.mobiforge.com/designing/blog/240x320-new-standard-screen-resolution">240&#215;360</a> as a guide screen size while mocking this up. Because of the massive range of mobile device sizes out there, it can become impractical to support every single screen size out there. 240&#215;360 strikes the perfect balance of practicality and the assurance that your site will look good on the majority of mobile handsets. It&#8217;s important to note here that compared to modern desktop screen sizes, this is tiny, around one tenth of the usual available size. The image below illustrates just how much smaller this actually is:</p>


	<p><img src="screen-size.png" alt="" /></p>


	<p>The first thing to sort out when building a site for mobile is the document type. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML_Mobile_Profile">This wikipedia article</a> has a good explanation of the different doctypes and their justifications. I chose version 1.2, making my page header look like:</p>
  
  <blockquote>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//WAPFORUM//DTD XHTML Mobile 1.2//EN&quot;
&quot;http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/DTD/xhtml-mobile12.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;</blockquote>

<p>I find the <a href="http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/">HTML Validator</a> plugin for Firefox invaluable while working with HTML. The extension displays a small red X in the status bar of your browser if your page doesn't validate. You may need to check out <a href="http://mobiforge.com/forum/developing/mobile-development/url-not-supported-version-error-doctype">Ruadhan's tip</a> for getting it to work with the mobile doctype. <a href="http://wapreview.com/blog/?p=184">This post on WAPreview</a> also includes some useful information for working with HTML for mobile.</p>

<p>The process of transferring the wireframes to well-formed, semantic HTML is the same as if it was a regular old desktop-browser based site. One thing to bear in mind is that you don't really have very much horizontal space to play with. Going with a fixed with layout for a mobile device isn't really practical because screen sizes vary so much, so a fluid design is preferable. This means that the order that elements are placed in the HTML can more closely relate to the order they appear on the site, which makes things a lot easier to manage.</p>

<p>It's worth noting at this stage that the HTML-only version of the site is perfectly passable, and a not-unattractive implementation of the three pages. If you're on a budget, or feel like being pragmatic, now's the time to push the site live and start taking orders!</p>

<p>Here's a few shots of how the wireframes above translate into plain html:</p>

<p><img src="browse-nocss.png" alt="Browse screen without CSS" /></p>

<p><img src="search-nocss.png" alt="Search screen without CSS" /></p>

<p><img src="view-nocss.png" alt="View screen without CSS" /></p>

<h3><span class="caps">CSS and Javascript</span></h3>

<p>Mobile-based sites can seriously shine with some CSS and javascript love. The built-in browser on Nokia's N95 for example, supports a fully CSS-compliant Webkit based browser. It renders CSS beautifully, it's just a pain to side scroll through sites designed for larger screens. With a lick of CSS with a mobile device in mind, the browser really shines.</p>

<p>If you're not doing any mobile browser detection (using something like dotMobi's <a href="http://www.deviceatlas.com">DeviceAtlas</a>) then a quick way to add support for a mobile device to your site without changing any html is to use the CSS media="handheld". For example:</p>

<blockquote>&lt;link href=&quot;/stylesheets/main.css&quot; media=&quot;handheld&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;</blockquote>

<p>While not universally supported, it gives you a quick win to ensure that if a device supports your CSS stylesheet, it will display that one.</p>

<p>CSS is best used to provide better visual separation between the elements on the page, and to fit more on the screen. There is some scope for lining things up horizontally on a mobile screen, and where possible it can be used to ensure that the most efficient use is made of screen real estate. Of course, if you have a flair for design, smart use of CSS will give you a chance to make the site visually appealing, in line with your brand. Not to mention a mobile site that will stand out from the crowd.</p>

<p>Here's how the site looks with a gloss of CSS paint:</p>

<p><img src="browse-css.png" alt="Browse screen without CSS" /></p>

<p><img src="browse-css-1.png" alt="Browse screen without CSS" /></p>

<p><img src="search-css.png" alt="Search screen without CSS" /></p>

<p><img src="view-css.png" alt="View screen without CSS" /></p>

<p>One message that I'd like to send home is that it's ok to use javascript to spruce up a mobile version of a site. One thing to note is that you should probably pay special attention to gracefully degrade any javascript you include, but using javascript to avoid page refreshes over oft-dodgy EDGE and 3G networks is an effective technique for providing a great user experience on your mobile site.</p>

<p>I normally recommend <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a> as a fast, efficient cross-browser javascript library. The compacted version is 54k, and 15k if you gzip it, which is a bit of a hit for mobile browsers, but the code that you need to write is so compact on top of that. 54k isn't a whole lot to sacrifice in page load time. Google also provide a <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/">hosted service</a> for jQuery and other javascript libraries that you can use for super-fast download times. However, use it with caution: there are cases when page load times over 10k will degrade user experience.</p>

<p>For the purposes of our sample app, I'm going to use a simple unobtrusive javascript technique to add support for showing and hiding the full details on our item view page. Here's the javascript:</p>

<blockquote>window.onload = function(){ //load this when the page loads
    
  //set up swap variables
  var summary = document.getElementById(&#x27;summary&#x27;) 
  var long_summary = summary.innerHTML + &#x27; &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; onclick=&quot;swap_full_summary();return false;&quot;&gt;...less&lt;/a&gt;&#x27;
  var short_summary = summary.innerHTML.substr(0,100) + &#x27;...&#x27; + &#x27; &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; onclick=&quot;swap_full_summary();return false;&quot;&gt;full details...&lt;/a&gt;&#x27;
  var body = document.getElementById(&#x27;view-page&#x27;)

  //do the swap
  swap_full_summary = function(){
  if(summary.innerHTML == long_summary)
    {
      summary.innerHTML = short_summary
    }
    else
    {
      summary.innerHTML = long_summary
    }
  }
  summary.innerHTML = short_summary
}</blockquote>

<p>The last step of the puzzle is to run the site through <a href="http://ready.mobi">Ready.mobi</a>. This will help give you a sense of how good your site will look on a mobile. I missed a few small things, such as a closing &lt;/a&gt; tag and not including a &lt;fieldset&gt; tag in the search form. These things may seem rather pedantic, but ensuring that your markup is valid is a good way to ensure that there are no upsets to users on certain devices. It's a free service, there's no excuse not to use it.</p>

<p>The sample mockups that accompany this article all get a score of 5 (Good) on Ready.mobi. There are a few warnings, but these I can live with for the sake of my site. I've covered all of the major factors in .mobi compliance. The important thing is to get a balance of functionality with as much compliance as possible. You can check out the compliance for the three pages here. <a href="http://ready.mobi/results.jsp?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdotmobi.rslw.com%2Fbrowse.html&amp;locale=en_EN">Browse</a>, <a href="http://ready.mobi/results.jsp?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdotmobi.rslw.com%2Fsearch.html&amp;locale=en_EN">Search</a> and <a href="http://ready.mobi/results.jsp?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdotmobi.rslw.com%2Fview.html&amp;locale=en_EN">View</a></p>
